Program to find stability of Routh Array using C++
Routh Hurwitz Criterion
=========================

Routh Hurwitz criterion is used for finding out stability of a control system
by using its transfer function. For this we form a Routh Hurwitz table and
check the first column. If there are any sign changes in the first column, the
control system is unstable. The system is stable otherwise.
